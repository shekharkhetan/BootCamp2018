This is to state that some of the solutions have been done with the help of Keshav and Navneeraj after discussions in Computation.
In Econ and Maths also the solutions has been done as a group.
For Computation, I took the help of Matt for "shut the box" problem and also for learning the test module. 
Thanks to Alberto and Leika and Bethany for solving my trivial doubts.
